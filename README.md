# minesweeper-api
Minesweeper REST API, developed using Django, Django REST Framewokr and Python

Target:
The following is a list of items (prioritized from most important to least important) we wish to see:

+ Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
+ When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
+ Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
+ Detect when game is over
+ Persistence
+ Time tracking
+ Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
+ Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
+ Ability to support multiple users/accounts
